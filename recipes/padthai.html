        dried shrimp, garlic or shallots, red chili pepper and palm sugar, and served with lime wedges 
        and often chopped roasted peanuts.</p>

        <li>3/4 pound bean sprouts</li>
        <li>6 ounces pad thai rice noodles</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ketchup</li>

        <li>1 cup green onion cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Blanch the bean sprouts in boiling water for approximately 
            30 seconds, remove, and drain well. When the water returns to a boil, add noodles. Cook 
            for 3 to 5 minutes until tender but firm; drain and rinse under cold water</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs with a pinch of salt in a small bowl. Stir together the lime juice, ketchup, 
            brown sugar, and fish sauce in a separate bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the garlic for a few 
            seconds. Add the pepper flakes and carrot, and cook for one minute, then remove. Add the 
            beaten egg, and gently scramble. When the eggs have set, pour in the carrots, sauce, 
            bean sprouts, noodles, peanuts, and green onion; toss together.</li>
